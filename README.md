How Trivia Works:
This is a timed trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.


If the player selects the correct answer, they will see a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question will automattically be displayed.


The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

If the player runs out of time, the player will be informed that time's up and display the correct answer. After a few seconds, then they will be shown the next question.

If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. After a few seconds the next question will be displayed.


On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
